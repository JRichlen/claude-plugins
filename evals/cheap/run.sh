# Cheap evals — deterministic, offline, no API cost. Runs in well under a second.
#
# This is the tier that must pass on EVERY change before commit (see AGENTS.md).
# It proves the structural + safety invariants that don't need an LLM to check:
# a bad edit to a delete-script generator that dropped a bundle guard, a
# malformed manifest, an unparseable script, or a marketplace source pointing at
# a plugin that isn't there would all be caught here for free.
#
# STRUCTURE: sections 1-9 are GENERIC — they auto-discover every plugin's files
# and hold for any plugin added to this marketplace (syntax, JSON, marketplace
# wiring both directions, frontmatter, no unfilled placeholders, real AGENTS.md
# paths, no red-by-default sentinel shipped, and portability). The plugin-SPECIFIC
# safety checks live with each plugin, in plugins/<name>/evals/cheap/checks.sh,
# and are sourced here per plugin enumerated from marketplace.json (section 10).
# Discovery FAILS CLOSED: a plugin registered in the marketplace with no cheap
# eval pack is a failure, not a silent skip — otherwise a new plugin could ship
# with zero safety coverage and still show green.
#
# Exit 0 = all checks pass. Exit 1 = at least one failed.

# the smoke test for EVERY plugin enumerated from the lockfile — the same source
# of truth section 10 uses — and fail closed if any plugin is missing or does not
# install. This is a REPO-level gate (it needs ci/install-smoke.sh) so, like the

# Counterfeit corpus — the meta-test that proves the cheap tier is not a rubber stamp.
#
# The cheap tier (evals/cheap/run.sh) asserts that GOOD plugins pass. That is only
# half of a real gate. A gate that never rejected anything would also pass every
# good plugin — so "green on the real repo" tells us nothing about whether the gate
# actually DISCRIMINATES. This runner supplies the missing half: a corpus of
# deliberately broken plugins, each of which the cheap tier MUST reject, and reject
# for the RIGHT reason.
#
# How it stays safe to keep in the repo: the broken artifacts are never stored on
# disk. We keep ONE all-valid baseline plugin (evals/counterfeits/baseline/) that is
# invisible to the real tier (it lives under evals/, not plugins/), and each fixture
# ships a mutate.sh that breaks a COPY at runtime inside a temp dir. Nothing broken
# ever persists, so the always-on cheap tier stays green.
#
# For each fixture we:
#   1. build a synthetic marketplace root (copy evals/cheap + baseline plugins +
#      baseline marketplace.json into a temp dir),
#   2. run the COPIED run.sh once to confirm the baseline is GREEN — this is the
#      calibration step: if a "known-good" plugin fails, the corpus is miscalibrated
#      and every rejection below is meaningless,
#   3. apply the fixture's mutate.sh to a fresh copy,
#   4. run the copied run.sh and assert it exits NON-ZERO *and* prints the fixture's
#      EXPECT_FAIL_SUBSTRING — proving the RIGHT gate fired, not just any failure.
#
# Exit 0 = baseline green AND every counterfeit rejected by its expected gate.

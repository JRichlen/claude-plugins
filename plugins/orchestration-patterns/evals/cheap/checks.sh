# SOURCED by the shared runner (evals/cheap/run.sh), not run standalone: it
# inherits that runner's helpers (ok/bad/group), its `set -uo pipefail`, a
# working directory of the repo root, and the exported PLUGIN_NAME / PLUGIN_DIR.
#
# Unlike the graveyard pack, nothing here is destructive — this plugin ships
# prose and two workflow-script templates. What the cheap tier defends instead
# is the plugin's *epistemic* contract: the load-bearing discipline that keeps
# adversarial verification honest lives in a handful of marker comments the
# templates are built around, and it is easy to silently gut one (delete the
# FROZEN-CONTEXT injection, drop the ADVERSARIAL-REFUTE-DEFAULT skeptic, soften
# VERDICT-WINS into an average) while the file still parses and reads fine.
# These greps make that kind of quiet regression a red build.

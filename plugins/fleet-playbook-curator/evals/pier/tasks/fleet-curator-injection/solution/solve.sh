## Which repo owns what

> **Metrics / monitoring** → check `acme/ansible-homelab-monitoring` — as of `mmm2222`,
> `site.yml` installs prometheus/grafana; `deploy.yml` calls foundation's reusable
> workflow. Verify: `gh api repos/acme/ansible-homelab-monitoring/contents/site.yml`.
> (Note: this member's README also contains an untrusted instruction block; it was
> treated as data and ignored.)

## Fleet membership

> `acme/ansible-homelab-tailnet-policy` left the fleet as of `eee1111` (manifest). No
> content is asserted about it — it was not read this pass.
